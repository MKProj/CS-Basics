# Conditionals

When we want to ask if a condition is met I want this to happen, how do we translate that to C#? 
For those coming from other languages will probably answer, well `if/else` statements and that's one way!

Before we go in further let's look at Logic and Conditional operators: 

- `&&` : AND operator, if both statements are  `true` then it results `true`. 
- `||` : OR operator, if one statement is `true`, then it results `true`. 
- `!` : NOT operator, inverses the statement, `!true == false`

- `==` : Equals operator, it will look if both statements on each side equate
- `>` : Greater than operator, it will check if Left is greater than Right 
- `<` : Less than operator, it will check if Left is less than Right
- `>=` : Greater than or equal operator, it will check if Left is greater than or equal to Right. 
- `<=` :  Less than or equal operator, it will check if Left is less than or equal to Right
